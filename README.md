# Neurowheel: EEG-Based Brain-Controlled Wheelchair

**Project Overview**

Neurowheel is an innovative project developed by Krithik Alluri, focused on creating a brain-controlled electric wheelchair using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. This project aims to empower individuals with neuromuscular disorders—such as ALS, spinal cord injuries, and other conditions that severely limit mobility—by providing a non-invasive means of controlling a wheelchair through thought alone.

**Background**

Neuromuscular disorders often leave individuals reliant on caregivers for mobility and daily tasks, significantly impacting their quality of life. Traditional mobility aids, like joystick-controlled wheelchairs, can be inaccessible for those with severe motor impairments. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have emerged as a promising solution, allowing for the direct translation of brain activity into control commands for assistive devices.

The Neurowheel project integrates an OpenBCI EEG Cyton headset to capture brain signals from specific scalp locations, including C3, Cz, C4, P3, Pz, P4, O1, O2, as well as using an ear clip for the SRB pin and FPz as the BIAS pin. The project employs machine learning algorithms to accurately interpret these signals, enabling users to perform commands such as moving forward, turning left, and turning right, enhancing their mobility and independence.

**Research Significance**

This project is grounded in the growing field of neuroprosthetics and assistive technology. By focusing on enhancing the user experience for individuals with motor disabilities, Neurowheel addresses critical gaps in current assistive solutions. The system's design aims to combine both technical precision and user-friendly operation, ultimately making it a practical tool for individuals facing mobility challenges.

**Goals and Impact**

The main goals of the Neurowheel project are to:
1. Develop an effective and reliable brain-controlled wheelchair that responds accurately to user commands.
2. Optimize the signal processing of EEG data to improve the accuracy of movement commands.
3. Ensure that the system is accessible and user-friendly for individuals with varying degrees of neuromuscular impairment.

By achieving these objectives, the Neurowheel project has the potential to significantly improve the quality of life for many individuals with severe physical disabilities, providing them with greater independence and control over their mobility.

**Future Directions**

As this project progresses, further research will focus on refining the machine learning models, enhancing the system's responsiveness, and exploring additional features that could provide further assistance to users. The long-term vision includes making the technology scalable and affordable, ensuring that it can be developed and utilized in various healthcare settings worldwide.
